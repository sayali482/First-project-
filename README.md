 Command-Line BMI Calculator

The Command-Line BMI Calculator is a simple Python-based utility that helps users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight, height, and age. It is designed to run in a terminal or command-line environment without any external libraries.

ðŸ”§ How It Works:

The program prompts the user to input:

Weight (in kilograms)

Height (in centimeters)

Age (in years)


It then calculates the BMI using the formula:


\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\left(\frac{\text{height (cm)}}{100}\right)^2}

Based on the calculated BMI, the program classifies the user into one of the standard health categories:

Underweight

Normal weight

Overweight

Obesity



ðŸ“Œ Key Features:

Lightweight and fast

No external dependencies

Basic error handling for non-numeric or negative inputs

Easy to use and understand

Based on standard BMI classification by WHO


ðŸ‘¥ Intended Users:

Health-conscious individuals

Fitness trainers or coaches

Students learning Python and health metrics

Anyone needing a quick BMI check from the terminal
